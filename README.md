# What is this repository?
This repository is for getting general info about Wrapper: Online, getting support, giving feedback, and seeing the current progress on development.
## Information

* ### QnA
  1. So, what is Wrapper: Online? 
        > The original GoAnimate Wrapper was released back in January 2020. However, it was released with many bugs. While a lot of them have been fixed, there are still many that remain. This project aims to completely rebuild Wrapper entirely. Wrapper: Online has a remade API, an account system, and a community around it. 
  2. What's the difference between the original and this one? 
        > The original Wrapper: Online was basically just Wrapper Offline but hosted online. There wasn't any special features, this is different, it won't be your usual "Change the logo, host it with Heroku" Wrapper. 
  3. How can I use it after Adobe Flash's shutdown?
        > A launcher will be provided upon trying to boot up the videomaker. This will install a browser that can use Flash and a version of Flash specifically meant for this browser. For Chromebook users, you can install the Puffin browser from the Google appstore. 
  4. So... When will it come out? 
        > There is currently no defined date for when Wrapper: Online will come out. You can expect it this year, however.  

* ### Features
  1. New and Improved API
        > Wrapper's original API has been rewritten in PHP for this project. It's more stable than the original and faster.
  2. Account System
        > The account system brings many possibilites. This eliminates many problems with publically hosted wrapper projects, such as you being able to see other people's videos and characters. This also brings more security, to make the site safe for everyone.
  3. Importing
        > Importing assets has been a big thing people have worked on with Wrapper projects, but all we have are workarounds. In Wrapper: Online, importing will be added at full functionality.
  4. Forums
        > Wrapper: Online's forums are a community gathering place and a good place to get support. They're simple to use too, just be logged in, and make a thread!
  5. Customization
        > You can choose what you want the site to look like. Do you want this style? Do you want an older style? Do you want an even older style? It's your choice.
  6. Moderation
        > Have you ever seen a video on an online Wrapper site that is a troll video or something innapropriate? Nothing gets done, these sites aren't moderated. With Wrapper: Online, this issue is fixed, we have moderators that can look at what's happening at all times. If you see a video not taken care of, there's a built in report system that you can use.
  7. Community
        > Wrapper: Online will have the community aspects that no Wrapper project has managed to capture. It's just like 2010-2014 done over again.
