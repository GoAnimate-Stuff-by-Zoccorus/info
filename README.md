# What is this repository?
This repository is for getting support, getting general info about the project, seeing progress, and giving feedback on Wrapper: Online.

## Support, Questions, and Suggestions
This repository can also be used to get support, ask questions, and suggest things.

## Support
#### Please note that this can be disregarded at this point in time, as Wrapper: Online is currently not released.
~~To get support, you can either [email us](mailto:wrapper.onlineofficial@gmail.com), or make an issue on the [issues page of this repository](https://github.com/wrapper-online/customer-support/issues). To make a support issue, please start the issue subject with "Support - (brief description of thing you need help with)", in the desciption of the issue, explain the problem in full detail so we can help the best we can.~~

## Questions
To ask questions, you can [email](mailto:wrapper.onlineofficial@gmail.com) or make an issue. Asking a question with an issue is similar to asking for help. The subject should be formatted like this: "Question - (ask question here)". A desciption is not required here unless your question is large. I would prefer you keep questions in different issue forms, don't put multiple questions into one please.

## Suggestions
To suggest things, you can [email](mailto:wrapper.onlineofficial@gmail.com) or make an issue. Making a suggestion with an issue is again like asking a question or asking for help. Make the subject of the issue "Suggestion - (suggestion here)". A description is not required unless your suggestion is large. Keep suggestions in different issues.
